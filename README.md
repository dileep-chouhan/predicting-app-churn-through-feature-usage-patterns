# Predicting App Churn Through Feature Usage Patterns

**Overview:**

This project analyzes user engagement data from a mobile application to predict user churn.  By examining feature usage patterns, we aim to identify key behaviors that correlate with user attrition.  The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of machine learning models to predict churn probability.  The results provide insights into which features are most strongly associated with churn, allowing for the development of targeted retention strategies.


**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (or specify the specific ML libraries used)


**How to Run:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will run the complete analysis pipeline, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and prediction.


**Example Output:**

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including metrics such as model accuracy, precision, and recall.  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization files (e.g., plots showing feature importance, churn rate over time, etc.) in the `output` directory.  The exact filenames and plots generated will depend on the specific analysis performed.  These visualizations aid in understanding the relationships between feature usage and churn.  For example, you might see a file named `churn_prediction_plot.png`.
